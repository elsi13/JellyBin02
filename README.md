# JellyBin02

Mobile application developed on a hackathon at the University of Glasgow. The application should be a concept of solving a problem of taking trash by the city councol in Glasgow. 
The solution in our solve this by tracking the position, fullness and types of bins, and it would alert the council if the bins are full. Additionally, users could mark spots on 
a map if there is a need to clean the streets.
